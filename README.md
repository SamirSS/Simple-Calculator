About
-----
This is a calculator app that includes very simple functions. I'm slowly adding new features that I think would be helpful in a calculator as well as more functionality. Right now, it only has four basic functions: add, subtract, multiply, and divide and two more advanced functions: square and multiplying by pi. If you have any feedback, feature requests, or ideas, please don't hesitate to email me or message me on Google Hangouts or Twitter.
