Simple-Calculator

What's New?
------------
Update 1.1:
- Floating Action Bar (FAB) button added. It's the circular button that comes to mind when you think of "material design", in case you didn't know.
- "Swipe to Clear" feature (instead of tapping a few buttons to clear the calculator)
- A Preferences menu to view any settings and to follow me on social media
- Circular overflow icon, instead of the old square one (overflow button is the dropdown menu on the right side of the action bar)

Previous Updates:
1.01 - New App Icon and Color Scheme
1.0 - First Release


About
-----
This is a calculator app that includes very simple functions, for now, that you would expect on a basic calculator. 
The drop down button in the top right corner allows you to clear the calculator and quit the app. 
In the future, I hope to bring a material design look to the app.
